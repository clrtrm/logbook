  - watched [Introduction to Algorithms](https://ed.ted.com/lessons/your-brain-can-solve-algorithms-david-j-malan) by David J. Malan
  - watched [What is an Algorithm?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_WfC8HwVB8) by Tech Policy Lab, University of Washington
  - read recommended answers to [What is the importance of algorithms in web development?](https://www.quora.com/Algorithms/What-is-the-importance-of-algorithms-in-web-development)
    - tl;dr: makes you better equipped, but it is mostly not necessary / does not make a huge difference. do not reinvent the wheel: *"you can probably go years as a web developer, and build exciting new apps without ever having to think about algorithms yourself"*. design apps that separate concerns: *"web apps that contain some serious data processing are flawed by design, and should be freed of any data processing"*. Focus on fitness for purpose and performance optimization.
  - did further researches about:
    - [load balancing](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/load-balancing/): *"the method of distributing network traffic equally across a pool of resources that support an application"*
    - [fault tolerance](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/fault-tolerance): *"the system’s ability to continue operating despite failures or malfunctions"*
    - [failover](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/failover): *"switching to a computer, system, network, or hardware component that is on standby if the initial system or component fails" "switchover requires human intervention to initiate the transition"*

- `Foundations > Introduction >  Motivation and Mindset` ([link](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-motivation-and-mindset))
  - read [How to Get Motivated: The “Do Something” Principle](https://markmanson.net/how-to-get-motivated) by Mark Manson
    - tl;dr: action creates motivation. small gains shape a friendlier starting point for future further actions. the belief that motivation comes first is flawed as efforts are often hindered by the symptoms of the problem *(working on a relationship to suppress resentment can be postponed out of such resentment, going to the gym to suppress a poor body image can be postponed because of such image)*. develop a ritual, cut distractions, and uncover the reasons for your lack of motivation.

  - for early-stage coders, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AIs (e.g. GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT) is discouraged:
    1. *By using a generative AI, learners may miss the opportunity to discover how something works and why things are done that way.*
    2. *Asking good questions is an important skill to have, and using generative AI to skip asking people (like our helpful Discord community) means that your development of this skill is delayed.*
    3. *Learning to talk about the code that one writes is another important skill. In a professional environment, it is highly likely that you will be doing code reviews where you have to explain the how and why behind what you are presenting. Using the Odin community to ask good questions about your code when you require help can help develop this skill as well.*
    4. *As David Humphrey mentions, the output of generative AI must be closely scrutinized, and learners who are new to programming generally don’t have a good overall understanding to be able to determine if the output is good or bad.
    5. *While learning how to provide good prompts to an AI tool is a skill, it is one that is supplementary to developing foundational programming skills. The Odin curriculum strives to teach that foundational skill.*
    6. *AI tools are designed to answer questions and are not designed to help learners develop research and problem solving skills. If you ask an AI for information, it will provide information to you. If you ask a human, they may invite you to share your understanding of the problem and offer some guidance on how to discover a solution.*
    7. *Without practice in research, problem solving and critical thinking, interviews could be a struggle since it is very likely that applicants would not be allowed to use AI tools.*

    - an interesting take would be difficult to summarize without denaturing, enjoyed the nuanced yet crisp writing style
  - read [How Taking More Breaks Will Boost Your Productivity](https://simpleprogrammer.com/taking-breaks-will-boost-productivity/) by Saeed Gatson
    - tl;dr: both macro-breaks (vacations) and micro breaks (coffee chat, lunch break) are beneficial for energy and mindset. *"mental concentration is similar to a muscle. It becomes fatigued after sustained use and needs a rest period"*

    - tl;dr: have *"faith that things are going wrong for a logical and discoverable reason [...] problems are fixable [...] there is a way to accomplish the goal"*; accept that *"someone will always tell you you're doing it wrong [...] you're not a real coder"*

    - tl;dr: neither mastery nor final level. *"The anxiety of feeling lost and stupid is not something you learn to conquer, but something you learn to live with"*
  - read [Deliberate Programming Practice](https://codequizzes.wordpress.com/2013/04/28/deliberate-programming-practice/) on Ruby/Rails Programming
    - tl;dr: it takes 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to achieve mastery in a craft: about 26 years if "only" working fulltime

    - tl;dr: *"neural connections form and deepen most when we make mistakes doing difficult tasks rather than repeatedly having success with easy ones"*, *"process praise acknowledges the effort; talent praise reinforces the notion that one only succeeds (or doesn’t) based on a fixed trait"*

  - the web was announced on August 6, 1991
  - the first website was that of the CERN (Conseil européen pour la recherche nucléaire)
  - ALIWEB (Archie-Like Indexing for the Web) is considered the first Web search engine, as its predecessors were either built with different purposes (the Wanderer, Gopher) or were only indexers (Archie, Veronica and Jughead)
    - robots.txt: a standardized file that contains instructions for bots i.e. which portions of the website they can or cannot access; can be used along sitemaps; useful for search engines web crawlers; respect relies on voluntary compliance.
  - 1993: Mosaic!
  - 1994: Netscape! Internet Explorer (which reached a peak of 95% usage share by 2003)! W3C (*"lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability"*)!
  - 1996: CSS (allowing HTML to be semantic rather than both semantic and presentational -> better accessibility)! Flash (originally FutureSplash)!
  - 1998: Web Standards project (WaSP)
  - The IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) is a standards organization for the Internet. It is responsible for the technical standards that make up the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP).
  - TCP / IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol; a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet.
  - security through obscurity: the (often dangerous) reliance in security engineering on design or implementation secrecy as the main method of providing security to a system of component
  - some sites like Google host a `humans.txt`file; previously, Google had a `killer-robots.txt` for the Terminator
  - Three keys: `User-agent`, `Allow`and `Disallow`
  - The wildcard `*` stands for all robots
  - The slash `/` stands for the whole website content
  - Comments can be used
  - It is possible to list multiple robots with their own rules

- **A/B testing:** a **variation** of a webpage or app is compared against a **control version**; statistical analysis is used to determine which one generates more engagement / performs better.
- "*Testing one change at a time helps them pinpoint which changes had an effect on visitor behavior, and which ones did not. Over time, they can combine the effect of multiple winning changes from experiments to demonstrate the measurable improvement of a new experience over the old one*".

- **CRO:** conversion rate optimization
